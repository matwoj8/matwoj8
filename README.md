## Hi there 👋

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at AGH University of Science and Technology.
I'm passionate about backend development, with a strong interest in algorithms and problem-solving.

Beyond the repositories you can find here, I'm currently working on:
- 🔌 A network simulator with dynamic topology for comparing the efficiency and stability of routing algorithms.
- 🧠 A deep-learning model designed to play and improve at blackjack

Apart from computer science, I also enjoy mathematics. I have experience from paricipating in math olympiad, and I ocassionally tutor students who want to strengthen their mathematical foundations.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to explore my projects! 🚀
